/*
Objective:
Students will work in small teams to collaboratively design and implement
reusable functions that solve specific tasks. This activity encourages teamwork,
critical thinking, and the sharing of knowledge within the learning community.



Instructions:
Each group will collaboratively design and implement three functions to solve specific challenges.



Scenario: Your coding bootcamp is organizing an event to showcase programming projects.
Your team has been tasked with writing reusable JavaScript functions to help manage the event.
Each function must follow the best practices for defining parameters, using return statements,
and maintaining a single responsibility.



Tasks:
  Task 1: Write a function to generate an attendee badge given a name and a role (e.g., "speaker," "attendee").
  Example Output: "Name: Alice, Role: Speaker"

  Task 2: Write a function to calculate the total cost of the event given the number of attendees and the cost per attendee. If the number of attendees exceeds 100, apply a 10% discount to the total cost.
  Example Input: calculateCost(120, 25)
  Example Output: 2700

  Task 3: Write a function to validate email addresses for attendee registrations. The function should return true if the email contains "@" and ".", and false otherwise.



Collaborative Steps

Design Phase:
  Brainstorm function requirements (parameters, return values).
  Assign roles: one person writes pseudocode, another writes the initial implementation, and others test/debug.

Implementation Phase:
  Write and refine the functions.

Testing Phase:
  Each team member writes at least one test case for each function.

Presentation Phase:
  Each group presents their functions to the class, explaining their design choices and testing process.
